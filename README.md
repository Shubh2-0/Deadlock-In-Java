🔒 **A GitHub Repository showcasing projects on Deadlock scenarios**

This repository contains two projects that demonstrate the concept of deadlock in different scenarios.



## Projects

### Example-1: Printer Scanner

🖨️🔎

This project showcases a simulation of a deadlock scenario between a printer and a scanner. The code demonstrates how two processes can deadlock when they both require exclusive access to shared resources, resulting in a deadlock state. Through this example, you will gain a better understanding of how deadlock can occur and the importance of resource allocation and synchronization.

### Example-2: Water Spices

💦🌶️

The second project focuses on a deadlock scenario related to water and spices. It presents a practical example where multiple threads attempt to access resources concurrently, leading to a potential deadlock situation. By exploring this example, you will learn about the importance of resource management and techniques to avoid or resolve deadlocks.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Shubh2-0/Deadlock-In-Java.git`
2. Navigate to the respective project directory: `cd example-1` or `cd example-2`
3. Follow the project-specific instructions provided in the README of each project directory to run the code and observe the deadlock scenarios.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to submit pull requests. Contributions that enhance the understanding of deadlock scenarios or provide additional examples are highly appreciated.

Happy coding! 😄🚀
